!important is used in CSS to override a property with the highlighted value. It is considered bad programming practice because it does not take into account the specificity of elements in CSS style sheets.

!important can be used to be able to define styles in old browsers, since these (such as IE6) do not take into account the !important, so a style can be defined below for that rule and it will be taken into account.
